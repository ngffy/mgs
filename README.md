# Metal Gear Solid Trivia
This is a repo with materials I used to run an MGS trivia game designed for
participants who have little to no knowledge of the series.

Much like MGS itself, this game is constructed to have players wade through
lots of confusing information to figure things out. Teams will need to flip
through a large info packet to find the answers to the questions. The packet
and questions have been written so that (with enough searching) all of the
questions can be answered, even by teams with no MGS knowledge.

## Structure
During the game, there are:
1. Two "standard" questions
2. A "bonus" question (recite a Snake monologue in Snake's voice)
3. Two more standard questions
4. Another bonus question (karaoke Snake Eater)
5. Three more standard questions
6. A final bonus

## Materials
This repo contains:
* A packet composed of:
    * Several pages of hand-selected facts about characters and events in MGS
    * A page with two monologues from Solid Snake (used for Bonus 1)
    * A page defining the S3 Plan as the Selection for Societal Sanity (see
      Question 6 section for more info about this)
* A presentation with questions designed to be answered with info from the
  packet
* Some materials for a web page involved in Question 6

## Tips for hosting
If you would like to use this material to run the game yourself, I have some
notes below.

### Bonus 2
For Bonus 2, players had to karaoke Snake Eater. While this *technically*
doesn't require knowledge outside of the packet, it might be difficult to
karaoke a song you're not familiar with. To work around this, I had the teams
negotiate with some of the people present who were familiar with the series but
not participating to represent their team for the bonus.

I embedded the karaoke video in the presentation originally, but have removed
it before uploading. It shouldn't be that difficult to find a video online.

### Question 6
Question 6 is probably the most complicated part of the game for both the host
and the participants.

As you may be familiar with, Ocelot believes the S3 Plan stands for Solid Snake
Simulation, but the reality is that it stands for Selection for Societal
Sanity. I wanted this question to mimic the complexity of this plot point, so
the packet the players receive gives the former (incorrect) definition, but I
only took the latter definition as correct.

For the participants to find the correct definition, they were expected to
search the envelopes I delivered the Bonus 1 monologues in (I gave a hint that
answering the question would require searching *everything* I gave the teams,
and also had the backup plan of texting the link to the participants in a group
chat). Those envelopes contained not only the monologues, but a link to a web
page. That web page contains a codec dialogue between Snake and Otacon where
Otacon explains that an updated definition is hidden in the second floor
bathroom of the building we were playing in. Then the participants would go
look for the sheet and be able to give the correct answer.

When I ran the game, I hosted the web page with GitHub Pages at
https://ngffy.github.io/mgs. If you don't have a second floor bathroom or just
want to hide the sheets somewhere else, you might need to fork or download this
repo and change the dialogue in the web page.

### Spoilers
The packet and questions spoil significant plot points from MGS1 and 2. There
are only minor spoilers for MGS3 and 4, and basically nothing from any of the
other games, including MGS5 and Peace Walker.

I've written the packet and questions so that everything you're expected to
know from playing the games in release order up through MGS2 is stated as a
fact. For instance, (**spoiler**) I assert in the packet that Big Boss died in
Zanzibarland, since that is what someone who has only played through MGS2 is
supposed to believe at that point. This shouldn't matter for the people
unfamiliar with the series, but it may be good to note if you have familiar
people so they don't go "well ackchyually...."

### Handling people familiar with MGS
This game is primarily designed for people who have never played MGS. In my
opinion, most of the questions are easy enough for people who have played the
games that they won't need the packet. If there are people present who are
familiar with the series, I would recommend not putting them on a team with
unfamiliar people, since it might make it too easy. When I ran this, the people
familiar basically just watched the teams scramble. You could also have them
keep their own score in their head for bragging rights.

### Setup
Here is how I set up the game:
1. Print the number of packets you think you'll need.
2. Split the two monologues on the Quotes page up and put them in separate
   envelopes. Also put links to the Question 6 web page on small slips of paper
   and put them in the envelopes. You will give these envelopes to teams for
   Bonus 1.
3. Hide the S3 pages.
4. Staple the remaining packet pages. Do not give the teams the Quotes page or
   the S3 pages.

### Making modifications
Obviously, if you want to change the questions asked, the info in the packet,
or anything else about the game, feel free. However, you might want to make
sure that the changes you make still allow every question to be answered by
someone unfamiliar with the series.

### Some more notes
There are condensed instructions and notes on the first few slides of the
presentation.

* There are no point values directly given anywhere for the questions. I just
  made them up on the spot based on how difficult I thought the question was. I
  think the point values I used were somewhere around:
  * Question 1: 10
  * Question 2: 10
  * Question 3: 15
  * Question 4: 20
  * Question 5: 25
  * Question 6: 30
  * Question 7: 30
* Question 2 is in there because 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of my favorite
  movies, and the people I was hosting for knew that. You might want to skip or
  change this question if you don't find it that interesting.
* When I hosted, the final bonus took longer than I anticipated. You might want
  to give teams hints on this question, and use your best judgment on other
  questions, as well.
* There was originally music from the games on most of these slides, but I've
  taken that out before uploading here. If you're curious or would like to
  re-incorporate the music I used:
  * "!" slide: alert sound
  * Title and intro slides: Encounter (MGS1)
  * Question 1: Introduction (MGS1)
  * Question 2: Intruder 2 (MGS1)
  * Bonus 1 - Life: Freedom to Decide (MGS2)
  * Bonus 2 - War: Love Theme (MGS4)
  * Question 3: Countdown to Disaster (MGS2)
  * Question 4: Deepthroat (Cupcakke)
  * Question 5: Cavern (MGS1)
  * Question 6: Arsenal's Guts (MGS2)
  * Question 7: Yell Dead Cell (MGS2)
  * Final Bonus: Main Theme (MGS1)
