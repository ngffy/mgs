		<p class="snake">What's up, Otacon?</p>
		<p class="otacon">Oh, good. I've been trying to contact you
		since the beginning of the mission.</p>
		<p class="snake">Kept you waiting, huh?</p>
		<p class="otacon">I gathered some new intel, and... Snake, some
		of the info on that sheet might not be right.</p>
		<p class="snake">Huh?</p>
		<p class="otacon">It might not matter right now, but it could
		affect the mission later.</p>
		<p class="snake">So what do I do?</p>
		<p class="otacon">It looks like an updated sheet is hidden
		somewhere in the second floor bathroom of that building.</p>
		<p class="snake">Second floor bathroom? I have to go all the
		way up there?</p>
		<p class="otacon">I'm afraid so. Snake, remember: this is a
		sneaking mission. Try to not alert the other teams. They might
		be looking for this sheet, too.</p>
		<p class="snake">Got it.</p>
